# some particles just floatin around

- Libraries im using:
    - glm
    - glfw
    - glew
    - imgui


TODOS:
    make paths cross platform for programs
    cross platform compilation
    make dt, boid count and size of box a variable, wind, gravity
    skybox would be cool
    full screen for video
    handle fps in a more conservative way
